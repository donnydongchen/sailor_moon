# Project: Sailor Moon

## Global Violence Visualizer

â€œI am Sailor Moon, champion of justice! On behalf of the moon, I will right wrongs and triumph over evil, and that means you!" - Sailor Moon

## Planned Tools:

R

gdeltr2 # retrieve GDELT data

ggplot2 # basic graphing

shiny # interactive plotting

geosphere # spatial method

threejs # 3-d interactive earth visulization

rworldmap # earth map creation

leaflet # a Javascript library for interactive maps within R

ggmap # reverse geocode longitude / latitude

plotly # more automated interaction

## Planned Techniques:

1. 

Bar Chart of Top News Types in a country with time series and region interaction. By giving a month and a year, the bar chart will show the top 10 news types. This bar char can also response for a given state (US only), country, or continent. 

2. 

Bar Chart of Top Media Resource in a country with time series and region interaction. By giving a month and a year, the bar chart will show the top 10 media resources. This bar char can also response for a given state (US only), country, or continent. 

3. 

Time Series Line Plot showing news/crime types occurance over time. By giving a particular state (US only), country, or continent the scatter plot will show the news/crime types occurance over time. This time series line plot can also response for a given crime type.

4. 

A Spinnable and Zoomable World Map with time series and region interaction. On the map, we show the occurance of a particular news/crime type via points. The size of points depends on the occurance. Hovering a particular country the world map can also show more detailed news summary. 


## Planned Interaction:

1. Time Series 

2. Hover Region

3. Zoom in Map

4. Spin World Map
